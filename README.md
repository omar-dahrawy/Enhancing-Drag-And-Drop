# Enhancing-Drag-And-Drop

This project is a prototype of a proposed system that enhances drag-and-drop operations on pointer-input based computers.

## How to setup

To run this project, simply clone the repo and add the src files to a new Java project. Don't forget to edit the package name. Then add the two jar files in the External Libraries folder to your project. You will also need to place the Data folder in your project folder once you set the project up. 

## How to run

In order to be able to test the project, make sure to create a folder with any desired name and destination, then add the folder's path to the Recognizer.java file at line 46 inside destinationPath String instead of the written path.
To run and test the program, simply run the Recognizer.java class. Once run, switch to your desktop and then you can start dragging any files to see the program working. The program only works on images currently but that could be improved later. After dragging, you can press Ctrl + U (whether on Mac or Windows/Linux) in order to paste the copied/cut item in the folder that you created.
